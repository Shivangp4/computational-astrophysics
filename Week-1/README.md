# Week 1

## 1. Setup

As we set forth to the *Project: Computational Astrophysics*, let us setup our development environment for all the incoming work. Clearing the air beforehand, there is no restriction on your choice of Operaring System for the same. The setup mainly comprises of

### - Command Line (*Windows*) or Terminal (*MacOS/Linux*)
Even though most of our work would be on GUI (Graphical User Interface), it is always benefical to know how to navigate your way around your pc just by typing some commands from your keyboard in that black box of command prompt/terminal. After all, programmers envy using mouse too much üôÉ. Check out a few resources for beginners and just get a basic idea of it.

### - Git and Github
For the assignments, we would expect you to fork this github repository and push your assignments solutions for the evaluation. In case you are not familiar with git or github, install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Very basic feel of git and github can be reduced to a google drive of codes, but there is MUCH more to that. Some awesome learning resources are:

- [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)
- [Git Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE)
- [Basic Git Analogy for Contributing to Open Source Project](https://medium.com/@thesagarsehgal/basic-git-analogy-for-contributing-to-open-source-project-8c314789326e)

### - Python3.x (*recommended x >= 7*) üêç
As discussed in the introductory session, we will be using python as the programming language for our tasks, chosing it over others due to its user-friendly syntax and learning curve, vast support of libraries and a huge community support among programmers.

Setting up any programming language in general is a two-step process; downloading and installing its binary executable, and second, adding its path to environment variable **PATH**, which is a way of telling the command-line what folders to look in when attempting to find a file. Follow the installation intstructions at:

- Windows: <https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows>
- Mac: <https://flaviocopes.com/python-installation-macos/>


### - Jupyter Notebook

And finally! We are on the last step of our setup. As discussed, working on a notebook eases the process of writing and maintaining code via code snippets in cells. There are two methods to run jupyter notebook, one is installing via old-fashioned python package manager pip, while the second recommended method is to install **Anaconda** (add one more snake to the list XD), as it has already has many other important packages installed.

- (_Recommended_) Install **Anaconda** from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Run the following command from command prompt/terminal
```bash
jupyter notebook  
```
or directly launch from the Anaconda Navigator. 

- Install jupyter using python-pip
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook  
```

Head over to the link you see in the terminal and go through this [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) to get familiar with the interface and features of Jupyter Notebook.
