## 1. Numpy (*Numerical Python*) ‚åõ

Heavy computational works require dealing with multi-dimensional arrays and matrix data structures. Python lists, in all their brilliance, lack in speed and make them unfit for such tasks.

That's when NumPy, a Python library comes into picture. It has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. Some of the learning resources are:

- To start learning and working with a software or a library, it is a very good habit to go through its official documentation first. A documentation is most accurate and would guide you the best in case you encounter bugs: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html

- A natural question: [NumPy ‚Äî Why is it so fast?](https://medium.com/swlh/numpy-why-is-it-so-fast-8087f4da4d79)

- I would highly recommend implement the code snippets in this blog in your notebook: [How Fast Numpy Really is and Why?](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-fast-numpy-really-is-e9111df44347)

- There COULD NOT be anything better than [100 NumPy exercises](https://www.kaggle.com/utsav15/100-numpy-exercises) to get that sense of superiority in NumPy. This kaggle link provides you with the answers. you may go through them and read, but the BEST approach is to write that down yourself. Hence I have added `100-Numpy-exercises.ipynb` file in the directory for you to code yourself.
